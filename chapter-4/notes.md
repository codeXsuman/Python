## **tuple**
In Python, **tuples** are immutable (canâ€™t be changed once created), so they donâ€™t have as many methods as lists. But still, they come with a few useful ones:

### Common Tuple Methods:

1. **`tuple.count(x)`** â†’ Returns how many times `x` appears in the tuple.

   ```python
   t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)
   print(t.count(2))   # Output: 3
   ```

2. **`tuple.index(x[, start[, end]])`** â†’ Returns the index of the first occurrence of `x`. Raises an error if not found.

   ```python
   t = (10, 20, 30, 20, 40)
   print(t.index(20))       # Output: 1
   print(t.index(20, 2))    # Output: 3
   ```

ðŸ‘‰ Apart from these **two direct methods**, you can also use built-in functions on tuples:

* **`len(tuple)`** â†’ Get length.
* **`max(tuple)`** â†’ Largest element.
* **`min(tuple)`** â†’ Smallest element.
* **`sum(tuple)`** â†’ Sum of numbers.
* **`sorted(tuple)`** â†’ Returns a sorted **list**.
* **`any(tuple)`** â†’ Returns `True` if any element is truthy.
* **`all(tuple)`** â†’ Returns `True` if all elements are truthy.

Example:

```python
t = (5, 1, 7, 3)
print(len(t))      # 4
print(max(t))      # 7
print(min(t))      # 1
print(sum(t))      # 16
print(sorted(t))   # [1, 3, 5, 7]
```
